resync
  Python script to automate the check of github hierarchical directories.
  The github directories are named with dir-subdir-subsubdir format such
  that tracking the hierarchical directories is easily trackable.

  The base directory being checked out to must have a manifest file with
  src/dest mapping or a ~/.manifest file must exist with the src/dest
  mapping.

  A typically manifest file would contain:

  # -------------------------------------------------------
  # Source                                           Target
  # ------------------------------------------------------- 
  https://github.com/marcilr/git-github.git          github
  https://github.com/marcilr/git-github-syntax.git   github/syntax

  NOTE: The target value can be a relative or fully qualified path.
